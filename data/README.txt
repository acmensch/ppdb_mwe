The SVM classifier is in build_classifier.py. To run, execute the file
in Python. The accuracy will be printed to screen.

Similarly for the baseline classifier (predicting majority class), which 
is in baseline_classifier.py.

The file mwe_indices.txt lists the indices of the MWEs that we considered
interesting for the purposes of classification. This was put together
manually.

The annotations of paraphrase categories are in 
random_sample_spreadsheet.ods.
